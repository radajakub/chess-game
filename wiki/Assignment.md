This application is a graphical two-player game of **chess** written in *Java* programming language.

There are two possible game modes:

1. Player vs. player
2. Player vs. computer

The game will automatically oversee all rules of chess and will not allow illegal moves.
(i.e. chessman moves, taking en passant, check, check mate, pawn promotion, castling, ...).

There will be option to save and load unfinished games.
Also any game can be exported in standardized **PGN** format and browsed or imported.

Players will also be able to manually prepare game board before any match.
Otherwise the board will be stationed automatically.

Chess clock will be implemented on separate thread(s).
